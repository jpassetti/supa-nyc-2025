# Creative Coding Demos â€” Table of Contents

This repository contains three step-by-step creative coding demos for high school STEAM and art-tech classrooms. Each demo folder includes:
- Interactive HTML pages for each step
- Teacher notes and classroom tips in each step
- Well-commented p5.js code for students

## Demos

1. **[Demo 1: Circle Grid with Randomness](01-circles-demo/index.html)**
   - Draw a grid of circles using loops
   - Add randomness to size and color
   - Animate and save generative art

2. **[Demo 2: Circles with Perlin Noise or Mic Input](02-microphone-demo/index.html)**
   - Compare random() and noise() visually
   - Animate with Perlin noise (1D & 2D)
   - Use microphone input for real-time generative art

3. **[Demo 3: Abstract Compositions with Shapes](03-composition/index.html)**
   - Build a grid of tiles with random shapes
   - Explore constraints, composition, and abstraction
